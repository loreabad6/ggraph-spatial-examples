# What is this about?

This post is to document my personal exploration on how to visualize spatial networks created with `sfnetworks` using `ggraph`. This all started with a [sfnetworks hackathon](https://github.com/sfnetworks/sfnetworks_viz) and should end with a successful PR to `ggraph`. 

I should start by saying, that it is probably a good idea to get familiar with `ggraph` (and `tidygraph` and `sfnetworks` while you are at it!) before going through this post. 

If you are already a `ggraph` + `tidygraph` user and would like to apply the possibilities to the *spatial domain*, then this is definitely a resource for you and a good opportunity to learn about `sfnetworks`!

# What can be done?

There are already several possibilities to use `sfnetworks` and `ggraph` together. *Why?* you may be wondering... well because `ggraph` was built as a way to visualize `tbl_graph`s from `tidygraph`, and guess what? `sfnetwork` sub-classes `tbl_graph` so basically you can do all sort of crazy graph representations with an `sfnetwork` already. 

The real aim of this integration is to allow you to do all this crazy graph representations **+** graph representations in geographical space! Not everything is possible yet, and you will see below some limitations. 

For now, I will illustrate how with the current *status quo*, we can already integrate `sfnetworks` and `ggraph` for spatial network visualizations. So let's get started!

# The Three Pillars

We need to start with **three** main concepts, the essential elements to create any `ggraph` visualization:

```{r, include = F}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggimage)
```

```{r, echo = F, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 8, fig.align = "center"}
pillars = "https://www.pngfind.com/pngs/m/78-788780_pillars-png-3-pillars-clip-art-transparent-png.png"

labs = data.frame(
  l = c("Layouts", "Nodes", "Edges"), 
  x = c(1.335, 2, 2.665),
  y = c(1, 1, 1),
  i = rep("https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e3/29/6d/e3296d231b926f7fde8550bb0ab5960e.png", 3)
)

ggplot(labs, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_image(aes(image = i), size = 0.25, by = "height") +
  geom_label(
    aes(label = l), nudge_y = 0.03, fill = "grey90", family = "serif",
    color = "black", fontface = "bold", size = 6, label.size = NA) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(1, 3)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0.9, 1.1)) +
  theme_nothing() +
  theme(plot.margin=unit(c(-0.30,0,-0.35,0), "null"))
```

1. *Layouts* contain the vertical and horizontal placement of the nodes, giving them a physical placement. In spatial terms, they contain the coordinates of where each node should be mapped. 

2. *Nodes* refer to which representation should the nodes have. And this really refers to which visual representation they should have, known in `ggplot2` as `geom`. Should they be points, tiles, voronoi polygons? `ggraph` contains a large list of node representations via `geom_node_*()`. 

3. *Edges* refer to the way nodes are connected between each other visually. Again here we are talking about `ggplot2` geometries and the `geom_edge_*()` functions should give you a big pool of options to represent this. 

Let's go through the possibilities to use these with `sfnetworks` also in these three steps.

## 1. `layout_sf()`

As mentioned before, a *layout* is basically the physical representation of where to place our nodes. The nice thing about `ggraph`, is that you can give your own customized layout. 

In `sfnetworks` on the other hand, we have a spatial network consisting of nodes and edges. These interrelated objects are stored together as `sf` tibbles into an `sfnetwork` object. Since we have a nice integration with `sf`, we can extract the coordinates of our nodes as an X and Y list, which we can pass to `ggraph`. Let me give you a quick demo instead of all these words. I will illustrate this with the `roxel` dataset from `sfnetworks`.

```{r}
library(sfnetworks)
library(sf)
(net = as_sfnetwork(roxel, directed = F))
net %>% st_coordinates() %>% head()
```

Now, how do we create a layout that does this automatically? Well here is a little helper function that will take care of that for you. It will put the X and Y coordinates of any `sfnetwork` object passed to it. 

```{r}
layout_sf = function(graph){
  # Extract X and Y coordinates from the nodes
  graph = activate(graph, "nodes")
  x = sf::st_coordinates(graph)[,"X"]
  y = sf::st_coordinates(graph)[,"Y"]
  data.frame(x, y)
}
```

How do we use it? Well, like this:

```{r}
library(ggraph, quietly = T)
ggraph(net, layout = layout_sf)
```

Yes! That's it. You are probably looking now at a beautiful white canvas, but internally `ggraph` has already a plan for every node you will map next, let's see it in action in the next step.

## 2. `geom_node_*()`

The most obvious way to represent a node in space is with a point. This is how we would do it if we were plotting `POINT` geometries in space. With `ggraph` we can get that representation with `geom_node_point()`. Note that other useful node representations in space might be using a label or text, we can achieve that with `geom_node_label()` and `geom_node_text()`, respectively.

Building on our previous plot:

```{r}
ggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +
  geom_node_point()
```

Oh yes, there are our nodes! But wait... If you are familiar with the `sfnetworks` vignettes, you might be thinking: *this looks distorted...* and yes, it does. 

Unfortunately, `ggraph` does not know about CRS so it will accommodate your X and Y axes to the size of your plot. This is one of the reasons why some internal tweaks are needed in `ggraph` to make this work better. But for now a way to go around this is to use `coord_sf()`:

```{r}
ggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +
  geom_node_point() +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))
```

Much better. Now, our plot also takes into consideration the CRS and places our nodes properly. 

Now let's give some aesthetics to our plot. If you scroll back up, you will see that our nodes don't have attributes, other than their geometry, so what should we look at? What about the degree centrality of the node? This will assign the count of the adjacent edges of each of our nodes. We can do this with `centrality_degree()` function in `tidygraph`.

A really nice feature about `ggraph` is that we don't need to go back to our original graph, mutate our network, save as a new object, and then call it again inside `ggraph()`. We can just call the function directly inside the `aes()`, where the calculation will be done on the fly! Read more about it [here!](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/tidygraph.html#access-to-tidygraph-algorithms-in-ggraph-code-1)

```{r}
library(tidygraph, warn.conflicts = F, quietly = T)
ggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = centrality_degree())) +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))
```

Directly passing functions also works inside `facet_*()` functions. `sfnetworks` has a couple of functions that can be evaluated in this way. To illustrate we can use `node_X`, which gives us the **X** coordinate of the nodes. 

```{r}
ggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = centrality_degree())) +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net)) +
  facet_nodes(~node_X() > 7.535)
```

OK, probably not a real world case scenario, but it gives an overview of what can be done! 

Let's move on to the final step, and connect these nodes to each other. 

## 3. `geom_edge_*()`

Now comes the tricky part. When we are working with graph structures in, let's call it, "abstract" space, the connections between the nodes is basically drawing a line between each pair. Although `ggraph` has quite a long list to represent edges ([see here](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/index.html#section-edges)), the connections that I find most useful for spatial networks are `geom_edge_link()` and `geom_edge_arc()`, which create a straight line or an arc between connected nodes.

```{r}
ggraph(net, layout_sf) +
  geom_edge_arc() +
  geom_node_point() +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))
```

Yes, I bet you are thinking this could go to [accidental aRt](https://twitter.com/accidental__aRt). This geom can come in handy for some data visualizations, you can see it in action at [the end of this post](#show-me-more)!

But now let's look at straight lines or *links* between our nodes. We can of course pass aesthetics to all the `geom_edge_*()` functions, which refer to edge attributes. Let's color our edges by the type of road:

```{r}
ggraph(net, layout_sf) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(color = type)) +
  geom_node_point(size = 0.75) +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))
```

I know that for now you must be wondering: if we have a spatial set of edges with an explicit geometry, why are we just drawing plain lines? Well, remember I said this would be tricky? This is exactly what is missing from `ggraph` and the core of what I want to implement. 

But, do not despair! I am here to show you some workarounds, not fully ideal but something to work with in the meantime. Let's remember that ggraph subclasses a `ggplot` object, so we can combine `ggplot2` functions, and any other package that extends the grammar of graphics. 

We will resort to `geom_sf()` for now. We can plot the edges of our network, by extracting them as an `sf` object with the function `st_as_sf()`. We have implemented a shortcut that allows you to choose which element of the network (nodes or edges), you want to extract. 

```{r}
ggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(net, "edges")) +
  geom_node_point() +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))
```

And there we go, a nice representation of a geospatial network! We can of course pass some aesthetics as well, for example an spatial edge predicate implemented in sfnetworks: `edge_circuity()`. You will see now that we can pass this predicates directly to the aesthetics inside `geom_sf()` and since our main object is a `ggraph` this expression will be evaluated in the network, pretty exciting!!

```{r}
ggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +
  geom_sf(
    data = st_as_sf(net, "edges"), size = 0.8,
    aes(color = as.numeric(edge_circuity()))
  ) +
  scale_color_viridis("Circuity") +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))
```
And there you have it, a swift overview of how to use `ggraph` and `sfnetworks` together. 

# What can't be done?

So yes, a lot can be done already, but as you may have noticed, there are certain things that just don't work yet with the current `ggraph` implementation. Here is a not at all comprehensive list of things that need some work:

- The `layout_sf()` function I showed you above will not work when there are columns named `x` or `y`.
- `ggraph()` does not consider the network CRS.
- There is no way yet to plot spatially explicit edges inside ggraph.

This last one comes with a couple more problems:

### Multiple scales for the same aesthetic

With `ggraph` one can give "color", "fill", "size", etc. aesthetics to both the nodes and the edges. In our current workaround this is not working so good. The plot will get rendered properly with the corresponding colors, but the legend does not know what to do, and will only use one of the scale elements, without a warning!

```{r, error = T}
ggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(net, "edges"), aes(color = as.numeric(edge_circuity()))) +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = centrality_betweenness())) +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))
```

### Faceting edges

Another missing stone is faceting by edges. This currently gives an error: 

```{r, error = T, results = 'hide', fig.show = 'hide'}
ggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(net, "edges")) +
  facet_edges(~type)
```

What to do then? Remember that I mention a PR? Well, I am working there to fix these issues, some of them already have a fix, others don't. I would certainly appreciate any help I can get. I opened [an issue](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph/issues/275) to illustrate the progress of my PR. Basically I am stuck with understanding `ggproto` objects to allow an integration of edges in geographical space. 

If you feel like exploring what I have got so far, install `ggraph` from my forked repo. Beware, this will replace the original `ggraph`, so do this under your own risk.

```{r, eval = F}
remotes::install_github("loreabad6/ggraph")
```

# Show me more!

While testing my `ggraph` implementation, I started looking for some spatial network visualization examples done with R that I could recreate with my code. Here I will keep adding what I come up with. Bear in mind that most of these examples are created with `remotes::install_github("loreabad6/ggraph")`.

### Break Free from Plastic 

For week 5 of 2021 in the [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) weekly data project, we analyzed data from the "Break Free from Plastic" initiative. Here is a [step by step guide](https://github.com/loreabad6/TidyTuesday/blob/master/R/2021/week_05.md) on how to recreate the final plot.

### Airports in the U.S.

This example is inspired on this [wonderful blogpost on Network Visualization](https://kateto.net/sunbelt2019#overlaying-networks-on-geographic-maps), where I tried to recreate the last plot showing airport connections and visitors in the U.S. Here is the [code to reproduce](code/airports.R).
